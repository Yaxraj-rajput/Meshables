# Meshables - 3D Assets Marketplace for AR/VR & Game Developers

Welcome to **Meshables**, your one-stop shop for all your **asset needs**! Whether you're building the next big thing in **game development**, creating immersive **AR/VR experiences**, or just need that perfect model to bring your digital project to life, we've got you covered.

### Why Meshables?

Because who needs *just another* platform with a few overused assets? Meshables is **community-driven**, ensuring a diverse range of assets that help you break free from digital monopolies. Plus, you can **trade assets** like itâ€™s a 3D stock exchange! More on that below.

## What Makes Us Stand Out?

- **3D Asset Marketplace**: Browse models for **AR**, **VR**, and **game development**, from vases to entire cityscapes. If it exists in 3D, it's here.
- **Blender Plugin**: Import and export assets directly between **Blender** and Meshables. Say goodbye to unnecessary steps!
- **Trade Feature**: Want more than just downloading assets? **Trade them** with other creators and developers like it's a stock market. Sharpen those negotiation skills!
- **Group Buy Feature**: Teams can now **purchase assets collectively** so everyone has access. Collaboration made easy.
- **Group Asset Access**: No need to buy the same asset multiple times for your team. If one member has it, everyone does.
- **Individual Previewers**:
  - **3D Models**: Spin, zoom, and explore every detail.
  - **HDRIs**: See the lighting setup before downloading.
  - **Textures**: View high-res patterns with ease.
  - **Printable Files**: Ensure compatibility with your printer.
  - **Code Files**: Review and run snippets directly in the browser.
- **AR/VR Ready**: All assets are optimized for **AR** and **VR** projects.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Whether you're on **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux**, Meshables has you covered.
- **Discord Bot Integration**: Need assets quickly? Just ask our **Discord bot** to fetch them for you, like DoorDash but for 3D models!

## How It Works

1. **Sign up** and explore our vast library of 3D assets. You might even discover something you didnâ€™t know you needed.
2. **Search, Preview, and Download** - Each asset type comes with a unique **previewer**, so you know exactly what you're getting before downloading.
3. **Trade Assets** - Have a 3D model you donâ€™t need? **Trade it** with someone else for something more useful!
4. **Group Purchases** - Collaborate with your team and split the cost of assets.
5. **Use Our Discord Bot** - Simply type a few commands in Discord to receive 3D assets without leaving your chat window.
